### Description
This repository contains the demo files for each hands-on lab work for the HTML5 and Firefox OS bootcamp held in December 2013.

View the slides on Github from [mozilla-ntu/slides](https://github.com/Mozilla-NTU/slides/).

By day 4, a WebSocket based chat client was built which will connect to a hard-coded server running a nodejs WebSocket server
(get it from [here](https://github.com/Mozilla-NTU/slides/blob/master/demo/server.js)).

### Running it in the Firefox OS Simulator

You will need the following:

- Install the [Firefox OS Simulator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator)
- Get the chat server running and update the IP address within `day4/static/js/script.js` to the server's IP
- Open up the day4 directory in the Firefox OS Simulator (App Manager -> Add Packaged App -> point to the directory)
- Start the simulator and you should see the following:
